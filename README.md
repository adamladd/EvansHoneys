# Webpage for Evan's Honeys

Evan's Honeys is an all-natural kettle style potato chip company that uses ingredients free of GMO's. Inspired by Korean 'honey-butter chips', we have developed our own original line of flavors: Cracked Pepper, Sweet Potato Cinnamon, and Tomato Basil.

We would like to use Evan's Honeys as a vehicle to bring a healthier, tastier snack to the world. Promotion and education to the world on the importance of the honey bee and the flow of a sustainable community is our goal. We are going to make the world a better place, one chip at a time. #onechipatatime
